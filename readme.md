# Record Shop API

An exercise in test driven development, focusing on approaches to testing CRUD routes and MongoDB / Mongoose methods.

The database consists of two tables: Users and Records. It is possible to create, find, update and delete from both tables using API requests. 

While the functionally of the program is relatively simple, test coverage is 100% in almost every file.
